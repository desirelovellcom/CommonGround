# Intelligent Internet - Gamified Whitepaper

A Tetris-like game that teaches the concepts from the Intelligent Internet whitepaper through interactive gameplay.

## Features

- **Black background with pastel gradients** - Beautiful visual design
- **Tetris-like gameplay** - Familiar mechanics with educational content
- **Memory efficient** - Optimized for smooth performance
- **Open source** - MIT licensed, easy to modify
- **Educational** - Learn about II-Agents, Foundation Coins, and more

## Components as Game Blocks

Each falling block represents a key component of the Intelligent Internet:

- 🟡 **Foundation Coins** - Intelligence-backed currency (Square blocks)
- 🟣 **II-Agents** - Sovereign AI assistants (T-shaped blocks)
- 🟠 **National Champions** - Validator franchises (U-shaped blocks)
- 🟢 **Anchor-Sets** - Data provenance roots (Line blocks)
- 🔵 **Culture Credits** - Local jurisdiction currency (Z-shaped blocks)
- 🟪 **Guardian Sentinels** - Network monitors (S-shaped blocks)
- 🟫 **Oracle Council** - Governance body (L-shaped blocks)

## Installation & Running
